              <p class="text-white">
                Generally, you will need permission from the landowner to metal detect on most sites in the UK. Usually,
                this involves sending a letter to the farmer and then following up with a personal visit. I've found
                that farmers are generally happy for you to detect on their land, as long as you can show that you are a
                responsible person. There are techniques which can improve your chances of gaining permission from
                farmers and I've summarised a method that works very well for me below.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                So, you’ve been using ARCHI, Google Earth and your own detective work and you’ve identified some
                seriously exciting areas of interest. Obviously, you’re dying to get on with your detector and bring
                light to potential artefacts lying in the darkness underground, possibly for centuries. You’re even
                dreaming of unearthing something that could rewrite history. But you’ve hit a brick wall and that brick
                wall is getting permission to detect on those areas. In this article I will tell you the approach that
                works for me. Not all the time. Life’s like that, but since I adopted this approach I’ve had calls from
                more than a few farmers asking me to detect and even someone from Ireland inviting me to detect her
                lands where the site of a Templar house once stood.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                However, there are other rules which must be respected at all times and never cross, so please don’t
                even think about it. The first is whether the site is a protected or scheduled site. If it is, leave it
                well alone, no matter what the temptation. These sites are so important to the understanding of our
                country’s history that they should never be touched by anyone other than a team of highly experience and
                qualified archaeologists. Always remember that the purpose of ARCHI is to help you discover sites
                previously unknown to archaeology, so that when your discovery makes it’s way into the archaeological
                record it may be a new piece in the jig-saw puzzle that represents our visions of the past.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                Metal detecting finds are constantly shedding light on the picture we create in our minds of the past,
                and now and again they re-write what we thought was the truth. I’ve been doing this for a long time, so
                take it from me that there are still many, many thousands of as yet undiscovered sites out there which
                have the potential to re-write history. In my previous incarnation I worked as a Data Analyst, so to me
                detecting is about collecting much-needed data, especially new data and it is the collection and
                interpretation of this data that creates our histories.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                Even then if you suspect a site you’ve discovered is significant, call the authorities immediately. As I
                understand it, as long as you have a right to be there, you will be adequately compensated, even if you
                are requested to no longer detect on the site.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                I’ve been doing this for nearly 30 years (mainly from my armchair...) and have found many, many unknown
                sites on aerial photographs and some while out in the field. So, concentrate on finding them and when
                you do, treat them with care and follow the appropriate protocols. All finds we make are gifts from our
                ancestors and while they might wish to tell you their stories, they need to be treated with respect,
                consideration and protection.

                Anyway, let’s begin.
              </p>

              <!-- Section header -->
              <h3 class="text-white">Getting Detecting Permission: Your Letter of Introduction</h3>

              <!-- Horizontal row -->
              <hr class="hr_white">

              <p class="text-white">
                Back in the day, I used to go banging on doors asking for permission. While many farmers are OK with
                this approach, many aren’t. Unfortunately, we live in a less trusting world than it used to be. Just put
                yourself in the farmer’s position. You turn up unannounced but with the best intentions but the farmer
                is already on his guard. Who is this person? What do they want?
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">Instead, prior to your visit send out a letter to the farmer introducing yourself
                and why you would like to detect on his land. I used to tell the farmer I was sure I was going to find
                treasure, thinking that this would excite their interest but in reality, you set up potentially
                unrealistic expectations. So, when in reality you continually turn up with bottle tops and broken
                buckles, the farmer may start to think you’re not being honest. And why wouldn’t he, especially if
                you’ve made such a good case that you will find something special.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                I’ve found that the best approach is to be honest and tell them that you are researching the area for
                evidence of as yet unknown ancient sites, for example a potential Roman road alignment and that you
                would like to research their land for indicators of say a Roman road. Of course, in the course of your
                search you may come across items of significance in monetary terms and also of national importance.
                Explain that in the unlikely event of this happening all the correct procedures will be followed and
                that you will deal with the authorities on their behalf. Farmers are very busy people!
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                It is always good to tell a farmer about yourself and make it clear that you will respect their privacy
                at all times and the rules of their farm. It really helps to provide evidence if you can that you are a
                trustworthy person. Letters of introduction from other farmers whose land you search are very good for
                this.

              <p class="text-white">
                This is an absolute must. Never go on any field without getting the permission of the landowner, or the
                leaseholder if they have that authority. Ensure that the permission is recorded in the contract. There
                are examples of adequate contracts on the ARCHI and other websites.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-white">You’re the Professional</h3>

              <p class="text-white">
                I once worked a productive farm and after a while I think the farmer got the impression that successful
                detecting is just a matter of putting the coil to the soil and bingo. I think I had made it look too
                easy. Consequently, he bought himself a detector and booted me off. Absolutely no resentment on my part,
                as I completely understood where he was coming from. However, I knew he would be lucky to find anything.
                In the early 90s Joan Allen told me detecting is art and I had come to realise how true the words are.
                So, emphasise to the farmer that you are skilled at what you do and even though metal detecting looks
                easy, there is an art to it, which only comes with experience and practice and that you have those
                skills.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-white">Giving Back to the Farmer</h3>

              <p class="text-white">
                Think about it. Why should a farmer give you free access to his land, when in doing so, it may bring
                additional hassle, which he most likely, could do without as he goes about his business.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                So, do something for the farmer from the onset. I know many farmers are interested in their own family
                history and the history of their farm and helping the farmer with this is the basis of my usual
                approach. Below are some readily available online historical records
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                I would recommend you acquire copies of the census returns for their farms. They can be sourced from the
                ancestry.com for a small fee. There are plans to host these records on the ARCHI website freely
                available to members.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                I generally include a copy of the census return as a gesture of goodwill and reassure the farmer that it
                is gifted to them under no obligations
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                Tithe Maps are some of the earliest detailed maps of farmers’ lands. They are a sure way to convey to
                the farmer that you are serious when you say that you will research the history of his farm and give
                copies of the documents you find in return for permission to metal detect on his land.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                It may sound cynical but I make it clear that there is more to come if they let you detect. Personally,
                I then pay them a visit a week or so later, introduce myself and show them copy of the 1891 census which
                I have to hand.

              <p class="text-white">
                Even though I say it myself as the founder of ARCHI (the Archaeological Sites Index), I have found
                farmers really appreciate copies of old OS maps of their farm. Some, such as the OS 1” 1st edition maps,
                don’t require ARCHI membership. I’m sure the farmer will be blown away by the LiDAR imagery of their
                farm.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                Again this level of background research tells the farmer that you a serious and capable person and if
                anyone is going to find anything it is going to be you.

              <p class="text-white">
                Showing the farmer an ARCHI distribution map of the various ancient sites on his farm will show them
                that you are serious and not wasting their time. Further, in my experience they are amazed at how much
                history has already been identified on their farm. Even when farmers see what hidden treasures may be on
                their land they are often well aware that they will never have the time to detect on their own land. So,
                be that person they can trust to search the land on their behalf.

                Like most of us farmers are fascinated by LiDAR. If they have’t already done it themselves, take a
                tablet with you and show them the lay of the land revealed by LiDAR. Similarly, use the Victorian /
                Modern Map overlay tool on ARCHI to show them the then and now images of their farm and lands.

              <h3 class="text-white">Final Thoughts</h3>

              <p class="text-white">
                The gist of this whole Mission for Permission is to be aware that you are often a complete stranger to
                the farmer and he is right to be suspicious of you. However, if you have genuine and honourable
                intentions and can show the farmer that there is something in it for them right from the start (ie free
                farm / family history research) you may find you build good relationship and might even put a few
                thousand pounds in his pocket as an added bonus.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white">
                I agree that you can get permission by just going around banging on doors, but once you start using the
                ARCHI database and aerial photos etc, and locate really promising farms, you need to do everything to
                gain permission. Most farmers want something in return, they are business men after all, so you are
                giving them something which most find very interesting and they quickly get a taste for the history of
                their farm and surrounding area and realise that you can do all that research for them!
