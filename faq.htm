              <h2 class="text-white">Automatic Password Changing Explanation</h2>
              <p class="text-white">
                We reserve the right to automatically change a password which the ARCHI password verification system
                has identified as having an unusual pattern of activity, for example being used from different IP
                addresses at similar times.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                We are aware that this may have raised alarm bells in some people, who may have been inadvertently
                picked up by the system.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                If you are the person who set up an ARCHI subscription, there are a number of reasons why this
                password might have been picked up by the system. Your internet service provider (ISP) may use a dynamic
                IP allocation system, which triggers our alert for multiple usage. Or, if you are very mobile when you
                use ARCHI then the system may pick this up. This is absolutely not a problem and we encourage you to use
                ARCHI as much as you can to help with your research.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                However, we need to protect the system from gross password sharing, which has been on the increase
                within the ARCHI community for a number of years now. Password sharing has a major impact on the load on
                the ARCHI website architecture, leading to reduced performance, reduced speed and website crashes. This
                isn't fair on the users who have taken out a paid subscription. Sharing with your close friend or family
                member is understandable but those who have been sharing with people further outside that circle has
                lead to an unintended explosion in over-use. Continued over-use will force us to raise the subscription
                prices in order to cover the costs associated with supporting these additional users who are not
                contributing. We feel obliged to address this now on behalf our valued paying members.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                Hence, we hope you are happy that we take measures to address the problem of wide-scale password
                sharing with ARCHI.
              </p>

              </h2>

              <p class="text-white">
                More than 85% of the sites listed in the ARCHI UK database are accurate to 6 or more figures in
                the UK National Grid Referencing System (eg TL 065 0227). This is the accepted accuracy for
                archaeological reporting with respect to the publications (eg journals, books and archaeological
                reports) the data has been sourced from. A 6 figure co-ordinate means that the site/find will be within
                the 100 metre square referenced by the co-ordinate.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                As an example, consider the Priory site at TL 065 0227. On the map the marker is right on the
                site. However, be aware that if for example a coin is geo-referenced to 6 figures, then the coin would
                have been found in the 100 metre square indicated by the co-ordinate of the find.

              <h2 class="text-white">
                What does it mean when a map marker pop-up says that the marker is a <strong><em>four</em></strong>
                figure NGR (National Grid Reference)?
              </h2>

              <p class="text-white">
                A four figure grid reference (eg TQ 12 34) means that that the actual archaeological site or
                findspot is within 1km of the place marked on the map. The reason for this lower than normal
                site/find-spot accuracy is because the data relating to the site is likely to have been published in a
                very old report, when it was only thought to be necessary to record sites and find-spots to the parish
                level.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                Hence, when a site record or map marker pop-up states that the source data was a 4 figure
                co-ordinate please be aware that the markers just marks the centre of a 1km square and the site or find
                is within that 1km square and not that exact point in a field.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                Going further into the old practice of recording sites/finds to the nearest parish or place-name
                associated with a find / site's co-ordinate, this is actually an extrapolation from the place's
                co-ordinate which is cross-referenced with the ARCHI database of place-names. Hence, in some cases
                a site may actually be in a particular parish but because the centre of a neighbouring parish is closer,
                the site is 'tagged' with this place-name. Again this is because many of the sites and findspots were
                just recorded as co-ordinates in the original publication and the place-name has had to be calculated in
                order to give some measure of locational context.

                The bibliographic sources for each of the sites and monuments listed in the ARCHI database used to
                be included in the sites lists but these were taken out a few years ago because we had a number of
                complaints with respect to the amount of viewable data on a screen on mobile devices. However, we have
                revoked that decision because many people have asked for them to be re-instated. Hence, we are now in
                the process of re-instating them but this takes time because the ARCHI data needs to be reconfigured and
                code re-written. As regards finding more about these sites, once the bibliographic sources have been
                merged with the sites data, the entries in the site lists will contain references to where the GPS
                location of the sites originated from plus where to find more information about these sites.

                On the Maps of Archaeological Sites, is the resolution of the marker positions based on the grid

              <p class="text-white">
                All the locations in the ARCHI UK database are held in the British National Grid Format. At least
                85% are to 3 figures or more (many to 4 or 5 figures). Regarding the decimal lat/longs, these are all
                extrapolations from the NGRs with the heart of the code referencing methods associated with the
                Herlmert transformations ie they are of the same accuracy as the National Grid References they were
                extrapolated from.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                Also, there is the problem of extrapolation from NGR to decimal lat/long and the inherent
                inadequacies associated with the translation. All the data in ARCHI is held as NGRs but plotting on the
                the maps requires translation to decimal lat / long.

                Regarding the place-name associated with a find / site's co-ordinate, this is actually an

                  Your use of the Services must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined
                  by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical customer usage of the Services. We will
                  consider your usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average
                  and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined
                  by us) (Excessive Usage).

                  Where we offer any included Services under a Plan or other Service, such use is offered for your
                  individual private and personal use and benefit only. In no case does any Service allow for
                  activities aimed at making profit or reselling the Service or using the Service in an unfair or
                  excessive way and any such use of the Services by you is a breach of this Agreement.

                <li>
                  If in our reasonable opinion we consider your usage to be unfair, unreasonable and/or Excessive
                  Usage we may immediately suspend, modify or restrict your use of the Services or withdraw in
                  full or in part your access to the Services without notice to you.
